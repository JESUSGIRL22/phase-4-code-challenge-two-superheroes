## Project Overview

This API provides endpoints to manage superheroes, their superpowers, and the relationships between them. You can create, read, update, and delete heroes and powers, as well as associate heroes with specific powers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SuperheroAPI
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Create the database and run migrations:

   ```bash
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
   ```

### Database Initialization (Optional)

If you want to seed the database with sample data for testing, run:

```bash
rails db:seed
```

### Running the Server

To start the API server, run:

```bash
rails server
```

The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /heroes**: Get a list of all superheroes.
- **GET /heroes/:id**: Get details of a specific superhero by ID.
- **POST /heroes**: Create a new superhero.
- **PATCH /heroes/:id**: Update an existing superhero by ID.
- **DELETE /heroes/:id**: Delete a superhero by ID.

- **GET /powers**: Get a list of all superpowers.
- **GET /powers/:id**: Get details of a specific superpower by ID.
- **POST /powers**: Create a new superpower.
- **PATCH /powers/:id**: Update an existing superpower by ID.
- **DELETE /powers/:id**: Delete a superpower by ID.

- **POST /hero_powers**: Associate a superhero with a superpower.

## Response Format

JSON is used for API responses. The response format varies depending on the endpoint and HTTP status codes:

- Successful responses have a status code of 200 OK.
- Created responses have a status code of 201 Created.
- Validation failures have a status code of 422 Unprocessable Entity.
- Not found errors have a status code of 404 Not Found.

## Validation Handling

When creating or updating resources, the API validates input data. If validation fails, the API returns a JSON response with details about the validation errors.

## Testing

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
rails test
```

You can also use tools like Postman or curl to manually test the API endpoints.
